**This is my personal geeky website, available at http://rominou.ovh**

&nbsp;

##What is this ?

It's just a personal website I created. I already have a professional portfolio I'll use to find jobs, but I wanted to have a more personal one with a funny tone I could share on the internet

##The lab

Available at http://rominou.ovh/lab is my lab. It's a single HTML page which runs various JS scripts, and I mainly use it to have fun doing some JS experiences. Whenever I have an idea of some silly thing I could do using Javascript I just go to this page and do it, then when it's finished I deploy it on the website

##The ML folder

This folder contains a basic Machine Learning game, more info about this can be found here: https://github.com/Rominou34/Machine-learning-game

##License

You can copy this website as you want, but as the home section contains some private information contact me first if you want to share it somewhere :)

Apart from that, I don't even care if you copy the whole source code to make yourself a website ( as long as you don't post it on Reddit to steal that sweet karma ), and it would even make me proud :)

If you want to copy the lab or use the functions inside of it to do some geeky stuff go ahead
